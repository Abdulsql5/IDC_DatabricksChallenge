# Indian Data Club 14 Days Databricks AI Challenge

This repository documents my learning journey through the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge.
The goal of this challenge is to gain hands-on experience with how Data Engineering and AI workloads are built and scaled using Databricks.

Rather than focusing only on theory, this repo emphasizes practical implementation, experiments, and learnings across Spark, Databricks concepts, and AI-related use cases.
